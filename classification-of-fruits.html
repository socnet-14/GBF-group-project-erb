The stone fruits include peaches, apricots, Plums, dates, Cherries, olives and plums. Apricots, plums are rich in organic acids that promote digestion and increase appetite, and cherry fruits are rich in iron and vitamins that have beauty benefits and anti anemia properties. This type of fruit is necessary to remove the core by using fruit destoner, and then the pulp is made by a double-stage pulping machine, and the juice is obtained by filtration and separation techniques.</p>

                <div><h7>Citrus fruits:</h7><p>mainly includes oranges, lemons, limes, kinnow, tangerine, mandarin, grapefruits and other fruits. The edible part contains fruit pulp and juice. The by-products of the processing process include the peel which can be used as medicine or feed, and the peel oil can be extracted to make essence or cosmetics. Citrus fruits contain rich vitamin C, citric acid, flavonoids and other substances, which can increase appetite, lower blood pressure and blood lipids. Due to the special structure of this kind of fruit (the flesh is segment shape, and the surface of each segment pulp is covered by a juice sac, and the flesh contains a lot of seeds), this characteristic determines that this kind of fruit juice extractor needs to be specially designed, the citrus extractor can effectively separate the pulp, peel, seed and oil. The freshly squeezed juice can be made into concentrated juice or NFC bottled juice.
